NAME:
This project is called Ti-cker and is short for Time Checker. It derived from different name ideas such as, TimeClock (Basic function of the application) Ti-ck (Short for Tick-Tock), and others. despite just being a project for myself, I wanted to pick a name for it that would work if it were a commercial product.

PROJET INSPERATION:
The idea for this project came from an old security job I had back at University. They were using what seemed to be an in house or open-source TimeClock application based on PHP (I think they have changed what they used to another in house application that I have not seen as I left prior to the switch). Its basic function worked but it had its flaws. Often it would fail to authenticate, and you would have to try again sometimes multiple times. That means you could look late just because the system did not authenticate properly, and you did not get paid for that time. It seems insignificant but it adds up over time. The reason it failed to authenticate was due to a security measure that just had happened to have many false positives. Another issue that it had was that the reports to show you your hours worked were not always the easiest to read and could get confusing. They also could be edited if you had the right privileges, which makes sense so that employers could correct punches if they needed, but there did not seems to be any accountability or safety measures to show changes or to verify that the change made was even correct. One of the biggest issues was that the interface was somewhat confusing and hard to navigate. There were different logins for different things and the whole platform looked very dated as a lot of in-house applications do.

PROJECT GOALS
1. Easy Clock-in/out
2. Easy to view Reports
   a. Total Hours Worked
   b. Pay Rate
   c. Start time and date of punch
   d. End time and date of punch
   e. Searchable by date, date range, total hours worked in punch, disputed, and changed status.
   f. Total Pay Before Taxes and other withdrawals.
      I. Can be searched based on pay period or custom date range.
   g. Estimate take home pay with the taxes and withdraws adjustable by employer.
      I. Searchable based on pay period or custom date range.
3. Easy to export reports to Excel, CSV, Word, and txt.
4. Easy to view, verify and dispute change history
   a. Shows who made the change to punch
   b. What changes were made to punch
   c. The secondary person who verified the change to punch (Primarily the worker of the punch) (can be turned off)
   d. Dispute change to punch process
5. User friendly UX and visually pleasing UI
6. Mobile Friendly

LANGUAGES/PACKAGES/LIBRARIES:
None yet, as I am in the design stage. Will figure this out as I learn what will work best.
