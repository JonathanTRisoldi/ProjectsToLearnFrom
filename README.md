# ProjectsToLearnFrom

This repository is for projects that I want to build just to learn things. They may eventualy get thier own repo depending on how they go later on, but for now they will be placed here. Some of these projects are going to be bassed on things I have used and though this could look and function a lot better, and other stuff may just be out of thin air. This is also going to be a place for me to relearn coding as I have been out of it for way to long and to learn new languages such as react.

Some projects that I plan to work on (More will be added as time goes and some may be dropped due to lack of interest):
1. Time Clock Application
2. Conways Game of Life (Updated version as I have built this in JS)
3. Guessing Game (Updated version as I have built this in JS)
4. Conversion Tools (Updated version as I have built this in JS)
